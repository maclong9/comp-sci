# Computer Science Notes

This repository contains my computer science notes organized as a custom Jekyll site.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `./docs/` - Contains all the Markdown files that make up the content of the site
- `./docs/_layouts/` - Contains the layout templates for the site
- `./docs/_includes/` - Contains reusable HTML components
- `./docs/assets/` - Contains CSS, images, and other static assets

## Custom Theme

This site uses a custom Jekyll theme with the following features:

- Clean, responsive design
- Dark mode support
- Optimized typography for readability
- Code syntax highlighting

> [!NOTE]
> You can use this project as a starting point for any scientific note-taking project by clicking the `Use this template` button on GitHub.

## Swift Playgrounds Book

If you clone this repository locally and open `CompSci.playground` in Xcode, you can explore the Swift code examples and interact with them.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure that you check `Editor > Show Rendered Markup` before reading through the notes.
